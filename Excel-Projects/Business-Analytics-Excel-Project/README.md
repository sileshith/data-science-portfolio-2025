# Business Analytics with Excel - Statistical and Forecasting Techniques

### **Overview**
This project applies core data analysis techniques in Microsoft Excel — including A/B Testing, ANOVA, Regression, Correlation, and Forecasting — to demonstrate end-to-end analytical reasoning for business decision-making. It reflects foundational skills from the **Data Science (Business Analytics Track)** program at **Arizona State University**.


## **1. Objective**
To analyze real-world retail business data using statistical and predictive methods in Excel.  
The project explores how data-driven insights can support marketing, sales, and operations decisions.


## **2. Dataset**
**Name:** Sample Superstore Sales Dataset  
**Source:** [Tableau Community — Sample Superstore Excel File](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000G551cSAB/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls)  
**Format:** Microsoft Excel (.xls)  

**Description:**  
The dataset simulates retail operations for an office supply and furniture company. It includes orders, returns, and regional sales data from across the United States. Key variables include:
- **Order information:** Order ID, Date, Ship Mode, Customer Segment  
- **Product details:** Category, Sub-Category, Product ID, and Name  
- **Sales metrics:** Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit  
- **Geography:** Country, State, Region, and City  

**Why It’s Chosen:**  
This dataset is widely used in business analytics education and professional visualization tools (like Tableau). It provides an excellent foundation for performing A/B testing, ANOVA, regression, and forecasting — all within realistic business contexts.

## **3. Analytical Techniques**

| Method | Excel Tool | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Descriptive & Correlation** | Functions & Charts | Understand overall data patterns and relationships |
| **A/B Testing (t-Test)** | Data Analysis ToolPak | Evaluate campaign or strategy differences between two groups |
| **ANOVA** | Data Analysis ToolPak | Compare three or more categories or regions simultaneously |
| **Regression** | Regression Tool | Identify predictors of sales and profit |
| **Forecasting** | FORECAST.LINEAR / FORECAST.ETS | Predict future sales trends using time-series data |


## **4. Expected Deliverables**
- **Excel Workbook** containing:
  - Cleaned and formatted dataset  
  - Descriptive statistics and correlation matrix  
  - t-Test and ANOVA results  
  - Regression output with interpretation  
  - Forecasting worksheet with trendlines, MAPE, and RMSE  
  - Visual dashboard (PivotCharts and summary graphs)  
- **Documentation** (README and summary notes) explaining:
  - Statistical results  
  - Business implications and insights  


## **5. Skills Demonstrated**
- Data cleaning and preparation in Excel  
- Statistical hypothesis testing (t-Test, ANOVA)  
- Predictive modeling (Regression)  
- Time-series forecasting  
- Data visualization and dashboard reporting  
- Business interpretation and communication of results



### **Outcome**
This project demonstrates the full cycle of data analysis and business interpretation using Excel — from exploration and hypothesis testing to prediction and visualization.  
It bridges mathematical reasoning with real-world business analytics, aligning academic learning with practical applications.
